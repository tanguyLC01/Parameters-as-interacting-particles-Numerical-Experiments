# Parameters-as-interacting-particles-Numerical-Experiments
This repository aims at reproducing experiments made in this paper "Parameters as interacting particles: long time convergence and asymptotic error scaling of neural networks", _Rotskoff, Grant and Vanden-Eijnden, Eric_, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.
We exhibit the evolution of the L2 error of the parametrized representation of high dimensional function as a function of the width of the layer.
